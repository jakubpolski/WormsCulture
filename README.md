# WormsCulture

A simple program created for a school project as a lerning experience of C++ basics and development in Visual Studio.

It's purpose is to simulate life of a certain culture of worms, depending on currently set parameters.

The main features are:
- A resizable map, which shows current amount of worms on a terrain and status of that terrain. (it's also possible to place worms on the map with the mouse cursor)
- A menu, which allows changing mutiple parameters at once, resizing the map or restarting the whole simulation
- A quick menu, which allows changing current parameters without pausing the whole simulation.
- A terribly slow map renderer

The program was only tested on a fullscreen window with a 1920x1080 monitor and will work only on Windows, lowering the window size will most likely break the map rendering.
